                    <p>Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Life finds a way. 
                    Life finds a way. What do they got in there? King Kong? Life finds a way. Is this my espresso machine?
                    Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!</p>
                    <p> Just my luck, no ice. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
                        Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
                        You really think you can fly that thing? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with 
                        whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.</p>

                    <p>You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. God creates dinosaurs. 
                    God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. 
                    So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever 
                    thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>

                    <p>This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, 
                    and... power windows. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. 
                    What do they got in there? King Kong? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining

                    Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. 
                    Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? They're using our own 
                    satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.</p>
                    
                    <p>What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with 
                    whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Yes, Yes, without the oops!
                    Life finds a way. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the 
                    OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>
